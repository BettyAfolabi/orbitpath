## What is OrbitPath?

Most people who want to work in space don't know where to start.

OrbitPath is a two-part application: a **live Artemis mission dashboard** that tracks the ISS in real time and profiles the Artemis II crew, and an **AI-powered career pathfinder** that takes your background and goals and generates a personalised roadmap into the space industry — complete with programs, certifications, and milestones.

---

## Features

### Mission Dashboard
- **Live ISS tracker** — 3D interactive globe powered by `globe.gl`, polling position every 5 seconds
- **Artemis II crew profiles** — detailed pages for all four astronauts with stats, bios, and mission context
- **Mission timeline** — scrolling sequence of Artemis I through Artemis V with status indicators

### Career Pathfinder
- **4-step quiz** — captures skills, interests, education level, and career goals
- **AI roadmap generation** — Groq produces a structured multi-phase career roadmap personalised to your answers
- **Data labeling loop** — users rate each recommendation, storing labeled data in Supabase for future model improvement

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Framework | Next.js 15 (App Router) |
| Language | TypeScript |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS v4 |
| Animation | Framer Motion |
| Globe | globe.gl + Three.js |
| AI | Groq |
| Database | Supabase (PostgreSQL) |
| Deployment | Vercel |

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- A [Groq API key](https://console.groq.com) (free tier works)
- A [Supabase](https://supabase.com) project

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BettyAfolabi/orbitpath.git
cd orbitpath
npm install
```

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root:

```env
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

### Supabase Schema

Run this in your Supabase SQL editor:

```sql
-- Stores quiz inputs + generated roadmaps
create table roadmaps (
  id uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid(),
  answers jsonb not null,
  roadmap jsonb not null,
  created_at timestamptz default now()
);

-- Stores user feedback labels on roadmap recommendations
create table labels (
  id uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid(),
  roadmap_id uuid references roadmaps(id) on delete cascade,
  recommendation_id text not null,
  rating int check (rating between 1 and 5),
  thumbs_up boolean,
  created_at timestamptz default now()
);
```

### Run Locally

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## How the AI Roadmap Works

1. User completes the 4-step pathfinder quiz
2. Answers are passed to a Next.js server action
3. The server action calls Groq with a structured prompt
4. Groq returns a JSON roadmap with phases, milestones, and recommended programs
5. The roadmap is saved to Supabase and the user is redirected to their result page
6. User rates each recommendation — labels are stored for dataset creation

The labeling loop is intentional: every rating is a training signal. The long-term vision is a fine-tuned model that improves recommendations based on what real aspiring space professionals found useful.

---

## Roadmap

- [ ] User accounts — save and revisit roadmaps
- [ ] Roadmap comparison — see how your path differs from the crew's
- [ ] NASA jobs API integration — surface real open roles matching your roadmap
- [ ] Fine-tuned model trained on collected labels

## About

Built by **Betty Afolabi** ([@devduchess](https://github.com/BettyAfolabi)) as a passion project — the kind of tool that should have existed when she first started wondering if a career in space was possible.

The space industry is growing faster than most people realise. OrbitPath exists to make the entry point visible.
